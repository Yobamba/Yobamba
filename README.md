## About Me

- Ask me about how to use AI to speed up development.

## Favorite Projects

- [Personal Task Manager](https://to-do-list-manager-nu.vercel.app/): As a huge fan of productivity apps, I decided to create one that allows me to organize and manage my personal tasks in a way similar to how we manage team work on trello. I love the satisfaction I get from dragging my tasks from to-do, to doing, and then done. 
- [Shot Analysis](https://github.com/Yobamba/shooting-analysis): I enjoyed this one because I got to leverage python's data analysis support to study and learn about shooting tendencies from NBA players and derive interesting insights from the study.
- [Django Portfolio](https://github.com/Yobamba/portfolio): I loved this one because I got to learn the django framework while simultaneously building a portfolio for myself.

## Technologies and Tools

- Proficient in: Python, JavaScript, C#, PHP, the MERN Stack. 
- Skills: Fluent in Portuguese, English, and Spanish, ability to work well in teams and integrate with different cultures, problem solving, and creativity.
